# IMG_rename
A Node.js code for renaming img files.

As your phone create image files it's giving them different names (for example "PANO" for panorama or "MVIMG" for moving image). In order to rename all of those files, to be with the same name, I have created this JavaScript code using the Node.js File System Module (`fs`).
